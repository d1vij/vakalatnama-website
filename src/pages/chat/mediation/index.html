                Sure. I paid Party B in advance for a bulk delivery of goods worth ₹80,000.
                </div>

                But only half was delivered, and I received no refund for the rest.

            Yes, if Party B refunds ₹40,000 now and the remaining ₹40,000 in two months, I’ll consider it settled.

            Thank you both for coming. Let’s start calmly — Party A, could you explain your side of the issue?
                </div>
                <div class="chat">
            Alright. Party A, would you be willing to accept a partial refund now and the rest in installments?              
                </div>
                <div class="chat">
            Excellent. I’ll document the settlement terms for both of you. No court, no stress — just a fair resolution.

                    I understand, but my supplier backed out last minute.

                    I didn’t intend any loss — I just needed time to recover the money.

                That’s fair. I agree to make the first transfer this week and the rest by the end of next month.
